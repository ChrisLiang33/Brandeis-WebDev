Final version:

The Brandeis University Student and Alumni Association (BUSAA) is a group dedicated to
building a community between current students and alumni of Brandeis University. BUSAA is
looking to develop a web application that allows its members to connect with each other, share
information about job opportunities, post events and communicate through a chat feature.
Additionally, BUSAA wants to display a list of upcoming events on the website and allow users
to join an event through a modal

To gain hands-on experience in building a web application using the Express.js.
• To implement user authentication and authorization in an Express.js application.
• To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
• To implement RESTful API design principles in an Express.js application.
• To implement a real-time communication channel in an Express.js application.
• To implement database design and management in an Express.js application.
• To develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
• To gain practical experience working on a project that has real-world applications.
• To add a relevant project to the student's portfolio or resume.

Your task is to combine all your previous Creative Project Assignments, make some necessary
modifications and add some new features to build a complete BUSAA web application that
meets the following requirements:
• User Authentication: The application should allow users to sign up for an account, log in,
and log out. Only authenticated users should be able to access certain parts of the
application, such as posting job opportunities or events.
• Job Opportunities: Authenticated users should be able to post job opportunities to the
application, including information such as job title, company name, location, and a
description. Other users should be able to view these job postings.
• Events: Authenticated users should be able to post events to the application, including
information such as event title, date and time, location, and a description. Other users
should be able to view these events and RSVP through the application.
• Chat Functionality: The application should have a chat feature that allows authenticated
users to communicate with each other in real-time. Users should be able to join a chat, send
messages to other users, and leave the chat.
• API for Events: The application should have an API that provides a list of upcoming events.
The API should be secured with unique API tokens for each user and should be accessible
via a URL endpoint and return the event information in JSON format

Event Modal: A modal should be placed on the application displaying the list of upcoming
events, and a button to join an event. When a user clicks the "Join Event" button of an event
in the event modal, they should be added to the list of RSVPs for that event.
• MVC Structure: The application should follow a Model-View-Controller (MVC)
architecture. The model should represent the data, the view should be responsible for
rendering the UI, and the controller should handle user request and interact with the model
and view.
• Route Modules: The application should divide routes into different categories of route
modules, such as userRoutes, jobRoutes, eventRoutes, and etc. Each module should have its
own file and should export a router object.
• Flash Messages and Comments: The application should use proper flash messages on the
potential success or failure of operations, and should also come with clear and explanatory
comment for each code blocks.
• Other Requirements: This is a complete project and shall follow all the design
requirements, code requirements and improvement guidelines given throughout the
semester via different CPAs.
